EXPERIMENT 1
1. the star will be displayed 6, because range 0 until 5 (include 5) is 6  
2. this code nothing display because the relationship between the values ​​of n and i does not conform to the conditions then the first condition is false.  
3. this code will be error infinite loop  , the condition always true make the * added infinite.  
EXPERIMENT 2  
1. the line is more than 1 with coloum , because the length of i changed to more than 1 with j length and i is for outer represent line and j represent coloum   
2. this output vice versa with the number 1 . the coloum is more than 1 with line , because the length of i changed to more than 1 with j length and i is for outer represent line and j represent coloum
3. The outer loop is the main loop that controls the primary count. The inner loop is the loop inside it, which must run to completion for every single iteration of the outer loop.
EXPERIMENT 3  
1. no ,the * display like only horizontal line.
2. the condition of looping is corect but we need a add sout.println in beetween inner while loop and update outer loop .   
EXPERIMENT 4  
1. the program in experiment 4 mean we will try to guess the number from random system ,and if false you can guess again until you right and the program will be offer to play again .  
2. After guessing the number correctly, you will be offered to play again. If you don't want to continue, type anything other than a capital Y or a consonant.  
3. done  
4. done  
EXPERIMENT 5
1. in this experiment you will input the temperature of a city every day start by day 1 until 7 ,
2. done
3. done
