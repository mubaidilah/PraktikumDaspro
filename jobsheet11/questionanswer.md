Question answer in jobsheet 1  
 experiment 1  
1. No, array elements do not have to be filled sequentially. You can assign a value to any valid index in any order you choose
2. because the  audiance[3][1] use String datatype and this index not filled 
3. done 
4. function of audiance.lenght is number of row in audiance variable.  
audiance[0].lenght is number of coloum in audiance[0]  
audiance[1].lenght is number of coloum in audiance[1]  
audiance[2].lenght is number of coloum in audiance[2]  
audiance[3].lenght is number of coloum in audiance[3]  
5. done
6. done
7. Advantages of the Enhanced for loop (foreach) Simpler and More Readable and Safer and Less Error-Prone, and disAdvantage is Disadvantages of the Enhanced for loop (foreach) No Access to the Index and Cannot Modify the Array/List  
8. row in in audiance is 4
9. coloum in audiance is 2
10.  done
11. done
12. done
13. String.join() is a static utility method that combines multiple strings into a single string, using a specified separator (or "delimiter") between each element.

6. done
 experiment 3  
1. done  
2. Arrays.toString() is a static utility method in Java that gives you a nice, human-readable String representation of a one-dimensional (1D) array  
3. the default value in int is 0  
4. done  
5. How to Make the Length for Each Row the Same? To make all rows have the same length, you must specify the column size in the initial declaration  
Can the Array Length Be Modified? No. This is a fundamental rule in Java.
