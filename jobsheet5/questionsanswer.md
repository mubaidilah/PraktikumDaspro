Experiment 1 If Cetak KRS
1. because the varable uktlunas is boolean type ,and in boolean type only have 2 logical values namely true and false
2. this program is not working ,because there is no comment when false
3. done
4. done
Experiment 2 Switch Cetak KRS
1. Without a break statement at the end of a case block, the program will "fall through" and execute the code in the subsequent case blocks, regardless of whether their corresponding values match the switch expression.The break statement prevents this by ensuring that only the code within the matched case block is executed.
2. for the syntax default the function is same with last else, that is for give respon another conditions mentioned in the IF
3. done
4. done
Experiment 3 nested Ujian Skripsi
1. the result is "Failed : the student has not been cleared of comparition",because in line 17 there a equalsIgnoreCase() when the input same with inside this then the result is true and when the different then false and follow the else or nothing
2. this line for Check whether students have had at least 8 meetings with Advisor 1 and at least 4 meetings with Advisor 2. If both requirements are met, students may register for their thesis exam.
3. The student requirement check process begins with checking the credit status.
If the student has not completed their credits → they immediately fail.
If the student has completed their coursework → proceed to check the number of P1 and P2 guidance logs.
Only if both guidance numbers meet the minimum requirements (P1 ≥ 8 and P2 ≥ 4) will the student be declared eligible for the thesis exam.
In addition, the system displays specific reasons for failure.
